Create a Message
As a user, I want to send messages to the platform so I can contact support or make inquiries.
Scenario: Successfully send a message with all required fields
   Given the user is not logged
   And the user fills the <name>, <email>, <subject> and <message>
   When the user sends a POST request to "/messages"
   Then the response should be a status 200 with the message “Success”
Scenario output
| name    | email   | subject | message |
| Jane | customer@practicesoftwaretesting.com | website  | Something is wrong with the website.|
| Jack | customer2@practicesoftwaretesting.com  | website  | Something is wrong with the website.|
| Bob | customer3@practicesoftwaretesting.com | website | Something is wrong with the website.|
 
Scenario: Fail to send a message when subject is missing
   Given the user is not logged
   And the user fills the <name>, <email>, and <message> 
   But leaves <subject> empty
   When the user sends a POST request to "/messages"
   Then the response status should be 422 with an error message “Unprocessable Content”
 
Scenario output
| name    | email   | subject | message |
| Jane    | customer@practicesoftwaretesting.com |     null      | Something is wrong with the website.|
