Scenario: Pagination is hidden when product count does not exceed page size
  Given there are <product_count> products in the catalog
  And the catalog page size is configured as <page_size>
  When the shopper opens the home page
  Then the shopper should see <product_count> products
  And pagination controls should not be visible

Examples:
  | product_count | page_size |
  | 5             | 9         |
  | 8             | 9         |
